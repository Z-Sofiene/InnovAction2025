# 🚀 InnovAction 2025 - Smart Solar Irrigation System  

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of **Smart Solar Irrigation System**, our submission for **InnovAction 2025**. This project was developed as part of our university club initiative, where we combined our expertise in **robotics, IoT, and AI** to create an innovative solution for sustainable agriculture.  

## 🎯 **Project Overview**  
We presented our **innovative smart irrigation system powered by solar energy**, with **remote monitoring capabilities**. The system is designed to **optimize water usage, reduce human intervention, and promote sustainable farming** by utilizing **solar energy and IoT-based automation**.  

### 🌞 **Key Innovations**  
🔹 **Solar Tracking:** Our **solar panels follow the sun’s position** like a sunflower, maximizing energy efficiency.  
🔹 **Intelligent Water Management:** The system **automatically refills the reservoir** from a well based on water levels and controls **irrigation according to soil moisture**.  
🔹 **Real-Time Monitoring:** All **data is accessible in real-time** via a **web interface and mobile application**, and stored in a **database for accurate tracking**.  

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**  
✅ **ESP32 Wroom32** – IoT microcontroller for sensor management  
✅ **Spring Boot** – Scalable backend for seamless operation  
✅ **MySQL** – Robust database for data storage  
✅ **Android Studio** – Mobile app for remote control  

## 🏆 **Why This Project?**  
- 🌱 **Sustainability:** Uses renewable solar energy to power irrigation.  
- 🚜 **Automation:** Reduces the need for human intervention in farming.  
- 📊 **Data-Driven:** Provides accurate monitoring for improved decision-making.  
- ⚡ **Efficiency:** Optimizes water usage, reducing waste and increasing yield.
